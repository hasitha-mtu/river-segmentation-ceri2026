Table 2: Critical Analysis - Feature Adaptation Impact
{'='*80}

Question: Is the projection layer (10ch→3ch) hurting performance?
Method: Compare ranking changes between pretrained and scratch training


PRETRAINED RANKING:
  1. RGB          - Dice: 0.8614
  2. LUMINANCE    - Dice: 0.8133
  3. ALL          - Dice: 0.8100
  4. CHROMINANCE  - Dice: 0.7846

FROM SCRATCH RANKING:
  1. RGB          - Dice: 0.8458
  2. ALL          - Dice: 0.8415
  3. CHROMINANCE  - Dice: 0.8332
  4. LUMINANCE    - Dice: 0.7788

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS:

1. Pretrained Winner: RGB
2. Scratch Winner: RGB

3. RGB vs ALL FEATURES:
   Pretrained: RGB 0.8614 vs All 0.8100 (RGB wins by +6.34%)
   Scratch:    RGB 0.8458 vs All 0.8415 (RGB wins by +0.50%)

4. CONCLUSION:
   → RGB dominates in BOTH training regimes
   → Additional features don't help (inherent to task)
   → Projection layer is NOT the main bottleneck
