Table 2: Critical Analysis - Feature Adaptation Impact
{'='*80}

Question: Is the projection layer (10ch→3ch) hurting performance?
Method: Compare ranking changes between pretrained and scratch training


PRETRAINED RANKING:
  1. RGB          - Dice: 0.8415
  2. ALL          - Dice: 0.7760
  3. LUMINANCE    - Dice: 0.7412
  4. CHROMINANCE  - Dice: 0.6793

FROM SCRATCH RANKING:
  1. CHROMINANCE  - Dice: 0.8242
  2. ALL          - Dice: 0.7114
  3. RGB          - Dice: 0.6515
  4. LUMINANCE    - Dice: 0.5981

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS:

1. Pretrained Winner: RGB
2. Scratch Winner: CHROMINANCE

3. RGB vs ALL FEATURES:
   Pretrained: RGB 0.8415 vs All 0.7760 (RGB wins by +8.43%)
   Scratch:    RGB 0.6515 vs All 0.7114 (All wins by +9.19%)

4. CONCLUSION:
   ✓ CRITICAL FINDING: All features WIN when trained from scratch!
   → Projection layer (10ch→3ch) IS the bottleneck
   → Additional features ARE useful but adaptation loses information
   → Recommendation: Develop better adaptation strategy
